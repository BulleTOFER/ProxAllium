# Credits
Give a man his credit where he deserves - *Unknown* (Actually, I created that on my own but I am not sure if it was influenced by some great person :stuck_out_tongue:)

## Programming Language
Thanks to [Jonathan Bennett](https://github.com/jonathanbennett73) & AutoIt Team for creating a wonderful scripting language called AutoIt! All of ProxAllium's code is 100% pure [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/).

## Tor
Thanks to [The Tor Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tor_Project,_Inc) for creating a wonderful thing called [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). Tor enables millions of people to be anonymous and circumvent censorship!

## Icon
The icon for ProxAllium is a combined effort from many talented graphic artists... that excludes me.

* Onion Icon made by [Roundicons](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/roundicons) from www.flaticon.com
* Computer Icon made by [Madebyoliver](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/madebyoliver) from www.flaticon.com
* World Server Icon made by [Prosymbols](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/prosymbols) from www.flaticon.com
* Double Headed Arrow Icon made by [Freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) from www.flaticon.com

All of these icons were compiled into one by me.

https://www.icoconverter.com/ was used to create the final `ico` file!

## Infrastructure
Thanks to [GitHub](https://github.com) (Code, Wiki and Issue Tracker Hosting), [Tux Family](https://www.tuxfamily.org/) ([Whole array of services to FOSS projects](https://www.tuxfamily.org/en/about)) and [freenode](https://freenode.net/) (IRC Network) for providing such generous services!

## You!
For using ProxAllium :wink:
