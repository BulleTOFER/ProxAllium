# Credits
Give a man his credit where he deserves - *Unknown* (Actually, I created that on my own but I am not sure if it was influenced by some great person :stuck_out_tongue:)
## Icon
The icon for ProxAllium is a combined effort from many talented graphic artists... that excludes me.

* Onion Icon made by [Roundicons](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/roundicons) from www.flaticon.com
* Computer Icon made by [Madebyoliver](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/madebyoliver) from www.flaticon.com
* World Server Icon made by [Prosymbols](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/prosymbols) from www.flaticon.com
* Double Headed Arrow Icon made by [Freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) from www.flaticon.com

All of these icons were compiled into one by me.
