# ProxAllium
Tor Proxy Bundle for Windows.
## What does it do?
ProxAllium's goal is to make using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en) (Not to be confused with [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en)) easier for normal everyday users to circumvent censorship and be anonymous while using internet-based services <sup>(up to some extent)</sup>. It's basically a wrapper for Tor, except that it tries to be more than that :wink:.

## How is it different from Tor Browser (Bundle)?
It is not a replacement for the `TBB`, ProxAllium does not come with any browser! You should configure your own browser to work with `Tor` (yes, `Tor` because ProxAllium is just a "wrapper", remember?). Don't worry because it's really easy! :smile: You just have to use the proxy created by `Tor`. The method for using the proxy created by Tor is the same as using a traditional [SOCKS proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS).

## Where do I download ProxAllium?
Expect a pre-release soon, hold your breath until then! **Please remember that ProxAllium is not stable, use it at your own risk!**

## Where can I find the main developer?
You can find me (TheDcoder) at the [Dcoding The Web's Forum](http://forum.dcodingtheweb.com) or at [#DTW in freenode](http://forum.dcodingtheweb.com/showthread.php?tid=8&pid=24#pid24) ([Webchat is avaible too!](https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net:+7000/?nick=DTW_WebchatUser?#DTW)).
